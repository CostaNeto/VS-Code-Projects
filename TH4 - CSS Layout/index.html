        <p>
          I have been working with <a href="somewhere.html">CSS</a> for a while
          now, and I have to say, it's pretty awesome. I love being able to
          separate content from presentation, and to keep my styles in an
          external stylesheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have had a good grasp on the basics, but there's still work to be
          done. For now, I'll keep learning by starting to understand CSS box
          model.

      <p>
        The CSS box model consists of four properties:content, padding, border,
        and margin. I've included a graphic from Coyier's article to illustrate
        this principle
      </p>
      <p class="clear">
        It's pretty easy to understand the Content portion of the box model. The
        content is whatever your HTML consists of. It could be a paragraph full
        of text, or a bulleted list, or an image.

      <h2>Padding</h2>
      <p>
        Padding immediately surrounds the content area. Padding is often used to
        give content area some breathing room by separating the content from the
        surrounding border area
